## Dependancy Manager
Dependancy manager tool which we are using in people portal is NuGet.
NuGet:-NuGet is probably the best-known package and dependency manager for, in Redmond's words, "the Microsoft development platform including .NET." As with the other tools I've mentioned here, NuGet helps you find, install, update and remove packages.
